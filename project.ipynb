We decided to research more about the subject and check the hotel prices in the cities near Tel Aviv and in the distant cities. After crawling the data from the hotel website, we will use an additional function with an API to calculate distances between two locations. Is there a connection between the price of hotel charges and its proximity to the center of country?"
